Calculator
Introduction:-
Simple calculator is a project to allow users to calculate basic four operations in mathematics ,they are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division but in this Project which I'm Implementing ,also included three additional operations such as Factorial, Power ,modulas .However, the input has to be in the form "number1 operator1 number2 "(i.e 2+4).

The input includes the command such as we can give numbers based on the operation for example for addition we give 1 as a command and that particular operation works.Moreover, this calculator is smart enough to operate multiplication/division before addition/subtraction/factorial/power/modulas, in another word it is implemented with the order of precedence logic.

STRENGTHS

The ultimate strength Calculators is its innovative,user-friendly and long lasting etc..

WEAKNESSES

do not inlude all the operations rather have onlty addition,subtraction multiplication, division ,modulas ,power and factorial.

OPPORTUNITIES

The tech-based market has a huge opportunities in capturing the youth market. And this calculator comparatively already one step ahead than other

THREATS

The slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world.
